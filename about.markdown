Before joining Spotify, I spent almost 4 years at DPG Media in various roles, all contributing towards a push for personalisation of news products.

Before that, I was research scientist at Google AI in London and data scientist at Blendle in Utrecht. I hold a PhD from the University of Amsterdam where I studied self-learning search engines. I was intern at Bing/Microsoft Research in Cambridge UK and at Yandex in Moscow.
