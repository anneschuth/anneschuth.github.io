I work on AI and Engineering for the Dutch Government, currently as Engineer in
the [Bureau Architectuur & Software Engineering](https://minbzk.github.io/BASE/) (BASE, in formation), where I primarily work on [RegelRecht](https://minbzk.github.io/regelrecht/) - an exploration into machine-executable legislation.
I also run [Axolotl Systems](https://axolotl.systems), where I provide ML engineering and platform consulting services one day per week alongside my government work, including working as ML Engineer at [Ditto](http://ditto.care/).
Before this, I was Engineering Manager of the [AI Validation Team](https://minbzk.github.io/ai-validation/).

I used to be Machine Learning Engineering Manager in the Search team at Spotify.
Before joining Spotify, I spent almost 4 years at DPG Media in various roles, all contributing towards a push for
personalisation of news products. Before that, I was a research scientist at Google AI in London and a data scientist at Blendle in Utrecht. I hold a PhD
from the University of Amsterdam where I studied self-learning search engines. I interned at Bing/Microsoft Research in
Cambridge UK and Yandex in Moscow.
