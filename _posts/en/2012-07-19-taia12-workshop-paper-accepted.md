Our paper “Sustainable Questions” with Bart de Goede and Maarten de Rijke has been accepted at
the [Time Aware Information Access workshop](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/milads/taia2012.aspx)
at SIGIR'12. Our paper can be found [here](/publications/de2012sustainable).

### Abstract

Community question-answering platforms have large repositories of previously answered questions. Reusing the answers for
new questions is tempting. However, not all stored answers will still be relevant. We deﬁne a new and challenging
problem concerning the sustainability of questions, and present metrics aimed at distinguishing between sustainable and
non-sustainable questions. We ﬁnd that an intuitive approach to sustainability of questions is not sufﬁcient, but that
simple properties can already distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable questions.
