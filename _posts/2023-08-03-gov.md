I had my last day at Spotify a bit over a month ago. Thanks, everyone for the incredible journey,
working alongside such great people and contributing to Spotify Search. It was an enriching experience that will stay with me!

It was a very tough decision to leave, but I'm excited to embark on a new adventure next week, working
for the Dutch Government. I look forward to contributing to the [Agenda for Value-Driven Digitalisation](https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/kabinetsbeleid-digitalisering/werkagenda/).
