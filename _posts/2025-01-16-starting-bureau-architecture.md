It's been 15 months since my last (and first) [weeknote](/2023/08/20/ivory-tower.html). That's far too long, but here we are. This week marks a new beginning as I joined Bureau Architecture, and it feels like the right moment to restart this practice.

## Why Now?

The timing isn't coincidental. Bureau Architecture, despite what I consider a somewhat misleading name, takes significant inspiration from GDS and Gov.uk. If you're familiar with the UK's digital government transformation, you'll know that weeknotes are part of their DNA. It's a practice that promotes transparency, reflection, and continuous learning - all things we desperately need in government digital transformation. 

## The Name Thing

I should probably explain my quibble with the bureau's name. It's not that architecture isn't important - it is. But making it the centerpiece feels like putting the cart before the horse. Architecture should be a means to an end, not an end in itself. The GDS motto "the strategy is delivery" resonates deeply with me though, and it's exactly this principle that draws me to the bureau's mission, regardless of its name.

## The Tools

The tools I have to work with haven't changed. I'm still in the incredibly painful world of Citrix, Microsoft, and BlackBerry Work. Documents float around in email attachments instead of living in collaborative spaces. Communication channels multiply like rabbits, making it hard to know where important conversations are happening. It's not just about the tools - it's about how these technical constraints shape our ways of working.

But here's the thing: despite these challenges, there's something exciting happening here.

## Why This Matters

Bureau Architecture has managed to attract some brilliant minds. In the complex landscape of government digital transformation, that's no small feat. There's a palpable energy here, a sense that despite the constraints and complexities, meaningful change is possible.

The challenges are significant. Government IT isn't just about technology - it's about navigating a maze of policy, legislation, and established practices. It's about finding ways to deliver value while working within necessary constraints. 

## Why I'm Optimistic

What makes me optimistic? It's the people, the energy, the timing, the focus on delivery, and the fact that we get to learn directly from the people that shaped GDS and gov.uk when it first started. 

I want to be here when it succeeds. Because despite the challenges, despite the constraints, there's a real opportunity here to make government digital services work better for everyone.
