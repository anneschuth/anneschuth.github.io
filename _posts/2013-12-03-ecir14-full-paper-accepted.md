### Abstract

We study the problem of optimizing an individual base ranker using clicks. Surprisingly, while there has been
considerable attention for using clicks to optimize linear combinations of base rankers, the problem of optimizing an
individual base ranker using clicks has been ignored. The problem is different from the problem of optimizing linear
combinations of base rankers as the scoring function of a base ranker may be highly non-linear. For the sake of
concreteness, we focus on the optimization of a specific base ranker, viz. BM25. We start by showing that significant
improvements in performance can be obtained when optimizing the parameters of BM25 for individual datasets. We also show
that it is possible to optimize these parameters from clicks, i.e., without the use of manually annotated data, reaching
or even beating manually tuned parameters.
