Our [Living Labs](http://living-labs.net/) (LL4IR) initiative received good news
from [ESF ELIAS](http://elias-network.eu/), we have been awarded two grants.

Firstly, we received funding to host, develop and maintain our LL4IR API. So keep your ideas and bug reports coming in
through our [issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/living-labs/ll-api/issues). Stay tuned, things will be faster soon!

Secondly, we will be able to (partially) cover travel expenses of participants of
our [CLEF2015 LL4IR](http://clef2015.clef-initiative.eu/CLEF2015/programme.php) Session. More info on that soon too.
