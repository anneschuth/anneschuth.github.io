One week ago, I took off from Amsterdam to settle in Moscow for 3.5 months. I was going to be a research intern
at [Yandex](http://company.yandex.com/), *the* Russian search engine and a major player in international search engine
land.

It was a good thing I printed a map with the location of my apartment, the taxi driver had no clue where to go when I
told him my address. But after about spending the best part of an hour in a traffic jam where he could study my map, we
did find my building among thousands of very similar buildings. It turned out that I was going to spend my time in a
rambling old Soviet building!

After an evening of fighting with banks and their peculiarities (the Dutch [ING](http://www.ing.nl/) allows a maximum of
two cash withdrawals per day while the Russian [Сбербанк](http://www.sberbank.ru/) allows a maximum of 5000руб per
withdrawal, these restrictions together allowed me to withdraw just over €200 with one card, my other card was
swallowed), sleeping a short night in a very hot room (central Soviet heating) and a continued fight with banks (yes, it
was a new day, so I could make my two withdrawals again) I took the superb Moscow metro and walked over the Red Square
to the Yandex office.

There, I was welcomed by two adaptation officers; people whose job it is to make sure new employees find their way
around the office. After a tour through the office and a lunch at one of the excellent Yandex restaurants, I had the
first discussions with my fellow researchers. And those discussions continued well into the current week. Now that I've
been adapted and accustomed to live in Russia in general (people open their windows to get rid of excess heat in their
apartments and simply use cash money instead of banks), it's time to focus on research! To support
this, [ELIAS](http://elias-network.eu/), an [ESF](http://www.esf.org/) Research Networking Programme, announced
yesterday that they have granted me an Exchange Visit Grant which will also allow me *financially* to stay here for the
full 3.5 months (this Soviet apartment with a 45 min commute to the city centre is way more expensive than any apartment
of the same size in Amsterdam). This is much appreciated and I will do everything I can to make it well spent by
bringing research and industry (even) closer together. In particular, the ELIAS network's aim is to reconsider
evaluation methodologies for information retrieval (IR) systems by bringing the users of such systems into the equation.
In the very recent past, my research has focused on exactly that aspect of IR. And also large search engines, like
Yandex and it's competitors, are known to have a similar interest. I'm looking forward to finding the overlap in
interests and all that may come from that!
