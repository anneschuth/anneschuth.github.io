These are my professional activities over the past years, including serving as a program committee member and reviewer for
top-tier conferences such as SIGIR, WWW, and WSDM. I have also organized and co-organized several workshops and events,
including TREC OpenSearch, CLEF Living Lab, and SEA Meetup. In addition, I have been involved in various journal reviews
and served in leadership positions such as chair of the FNWI PhD Council.
