## Summary

This presentation introduces OpenSearch, a novel evaluation paradigm for information retrieval that leverages existing search engines as experimentation platforms. The approach allows researchers to replace components of live search systems and evaluate these components using interactions with real, unsuspecting users through interleaving methodologies. This methodology represents a significant advancement in IR evaluation by moving beyond synthetic datasets to real-world user interactions and authentic search behaviors.
