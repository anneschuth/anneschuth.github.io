The KION Thesis Award is a national prize awarded annually by the joint Artificial Intelligence degree programmes in the Netherlands (KION: Kunstmatige Intelligentie-Opleidingen in Nederland) for the best thesis in the field of artificial intelligence.

I was the 2010 - 2011 award winner with my master thesis "Tuning Methods in Statistical Machine Translation". I presented it at BNAIC.
