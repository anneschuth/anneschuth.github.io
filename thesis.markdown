On May 27, 2016, I publicly defended my dissertation [Search Engines that Learn from Their Users](/assets/thesis_anne-schuth_search-engines-that-learn-from-their-users.pdf) at the University of Amsterdam.

My defense was recorded and can be [viewed online on the website of the university](http://webcolleges.uva.nl/Mediasite/Play/1ee49f6e8d55445496b574b5df73fd3d1d).
