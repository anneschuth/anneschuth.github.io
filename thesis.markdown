On May 27, 2016, I publicly defended my
dissertation [Search Engines that Learn from Their Users](/publications/schuth-phd-thesis-2016) at the University of
Amsterdam.

My defense was recorded and can
be [viewed online on the website of the university](http://webcolleges.uva.nl/Mediasite/Play/1ee49f6e8d55445496b574b5df73fd3d1d).
