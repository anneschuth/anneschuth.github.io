A result page of a modern web search engine is often much more complicated than a simple list of “ten blue links.” In
particular, a search engine may combine results from different sources (e.g., Web, News, and Images), and display these
as grouped results to provide a better user experience. Such a system is called an aggregated or federated search
system.
