We introduce two metrics aimed at evaluating systems that select facetvalues for a faceted search interface. Facetvalues
are the values of meta-data fields in semi-structured data and are commonly used to refine queries. It is often the case
that there are more facetvalues than can be displayed to a user and thus a selection has to be made. Our metrics
evaluate these selections based on binary relevant assessments for the documents in a collection. Both our metrics are
based on Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain, an often used Information Retrieval metric.
