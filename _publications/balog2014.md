The information retrieval (IR) community strives to make evaluation more centered on real users and their needs. The
living labs evaluation paradigm, i.e., observing users in their natural task environments, offers great promise in this
regard. Yet, progress in an academic setting has been limited. This paper presents the first living labs for the IR
community benchmarking campaign initiative, taking as test two use-cases: local domain search on a university website
and product search on an e-commerce site. There are many challenges associated with this setting, including
incorporating results from experimental search systems into live production systems, and obtaining sufficiently many
impressions from relatively low traffic sites. We propose that head queries can be used to generate result lists
offline, which are then interleaved with results of the production system for live evaluation. An API is developed to
orchestrate the communication between commercial parties and benchmark participants. This campaign acts to progress the
living labs for IR evaluation methodology, and offers important insight into the role of living labs in this space.
