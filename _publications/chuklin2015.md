A result page of a modern search engine often goes beyond a simple list of “10 blue links.” Many specific user needs (
e.g., News, Image, Video) are addressed by so-called aggregated or vertical search solutions: specially presented
documents, often retrieved from specific sources, that stand out from the regular organic Web search results. When it
comes to evaluating ranking systems, such complex result layouts raise their own challenges. This is especially true for
so-called interleaving methods that have arisen as an important type of online evaluation: by mixing results from two
different result pages, interleaving can easily break the desired Web layout in which vertical documents are grouped
together, and hence hurt the user experience.
