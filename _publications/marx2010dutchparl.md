A corpus called DutchParl is created which aims to contain all digitally available parliamentary documents written in
the Dutch language. The first version of DutchParl contains documents from the parliaments of The Netherlands, Flanders
and Belgium. The corpus is divided along three dimensions: per parliament, scanned or digital documents, written
recordings of spoken text and others. The digital collection contains more than 800 million tokens, the scanned
collection more than 1 billion.
