Community question answering platforms have large repositories of previously answered questions. Reusing the answers for
new questions is tempting. However, not all stored answers will still be relevant. We define a new and challenging
problem concerning the sustainability of questions, and present metrics aimed at distinguishing between sustainable and
non-sustainable questions. We find that an intuitive approach to sustainability of questions is not sufficient, but that
simple properties can already distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable questions.
