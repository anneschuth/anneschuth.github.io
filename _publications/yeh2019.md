In this paper, we describe our attempt to learn bias from news articles.
From our experiments, it seems that although there is a correlation between publisher bias and article bias, it is
challenging to learn bias directly from the publisher labels. On the other hand, using few manually-labeled samples can
increase the accuracy metric from around 60% to near 80%. Our system is computationally inexpensive and uses several
standard document representations in NLP to train an SVM or LR classifier.
The system ranked 4th in the SemEval2019
task. [The code is released for reproducibility](https://github.com/chialun-yeh/SemEval2019).
