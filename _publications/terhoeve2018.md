There is an increasing demand for algorithms to explain their outcomes. So far, there is no method that explains the
rankings produced by a ranking algorithm. To address this gap we propose LISTEN, a LISTwise ExplaiNer, to explain
rankings produced by a ranking algorithm. To efficiently use LISTEN in production, we train a neural network to learn
the underlying explanation space created by LISTEN; we call this model Q-LISTEN. We show that LISTEN produces faithful
explanations and that Q-LISTEN is able to learn these explanations. Moreover, we show that LISTEN is safe to use in a
real world environment: users of a news recommendation system do not behave significantly differently when they are
exposed to explanations generated by LISTEN instead of manually generated explanations.
