Online learning to rank for information retrieval (IR) holds promise for allowing the development of “self-learning”
search engines that can automatically adjust to their users. With the large amount of e.g., click data that can be
collected in web search settings, such techniques could enable highly scalable ranking optimization. However, feedback
obtained from user interactions is noisy, and developing approaches that can learn from this feedback quickly and
reliably is a major challenge. In this paper we investigate whether and how previously collected (historical)
interaction data can be used to speed up learning in online learning to rank for IR. We devise the first two methods
that can utilize historical data (1) to make feedback available during learning more reliable and (2) to preselect
candidate ranking functions to be evaluated in interactions with users of the retrieval system. We evaluate both
approaches on 9 learning to rank data sets and find that historical data can speed up learning, leading to substantially
and significantly higher online performance. In particular, our preselection method proves highly effective at
compensating for noise in user feedback. Our results show that historical data can be used to make online learning to
rank for IR much more effective than previously possible, especially when feedback is noisy.
