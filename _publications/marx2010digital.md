We address the problem of publishing parliamentary pro- ceedings in a digital sustainable manner. We give an ex- tensive requirements analysis, and based on that propose a uniform XML format. We evaluated our approach by col- lecting and automatically processing proceedings from six parliaments spanning almost 200 years in total. Most of this data is real legacy data consisting of scanned and OCRed documents. The approach scales very well and produces high quality data.
