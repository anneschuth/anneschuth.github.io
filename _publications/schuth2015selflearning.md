How does a search engine such as Google know which search results to display? There are many competing algorithms that
generate search results, but which one works best? We developed a new probabilistic method for quickly comparing large
numbers of search algorithms by examining the results users click on. Our study was presented at SIGIR 2015, the leading
international conference on information retrieval, held in Santiago (Chili) last summer.
