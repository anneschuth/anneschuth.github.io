In this paper we report on the first Living Labs for Information Retrieval Evaluation (LL4IR) CLEF Lab. Our main goal
with the lab is to provide a benchmarking platform for researchers to evaluate their ranking systems in a live setting
with real users in their natural task environments. For this first edition of the challenge we focused on two specific
use-cases: product search and web search. Ranking systems submitted by participants were experimentally compared using
interleaved comparisons to the production system from the corresponding use-case. In this paper we describe how these
experiments were performed, what the resulting outcomes are, and conclude with some lessons learned.
