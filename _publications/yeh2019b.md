We present a new Dutch news dataset with labeled partisanship.
The dataset contains more than 100K articles that are labeled on the publisher level and 776 articles that were
crowdsourced using an internal survey platform and labeled on the article level.
In this paper, we document our original motivation, the collection and annotation process, limitations, and
applications.
